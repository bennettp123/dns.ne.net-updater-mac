## Oops!

I typo'd the repo name! Herpaderp.

This repo is inactive; future dev will occur on the non-typo'd repo [here](https://github.com/bennettp123/dns.he.net-updater-unix).

This repo may be removed some time in the future, but for now, I'll leave it here as a testament to my atrocious speeliung.

### dns.he.net Linux/OS X dynamic dns updater

A very basic updater for dynamic DNS services provided by <http://dns.he.net/>. 

## Instructions:

 1. `dns.he.net_updater.sh --help`
 2. `dns.he.net_updater.sh -h <fqdn> -p <password>`
 3. Use the included LaunchDaemon to schedule the updates. Or cron. Whatever floats your boat.
